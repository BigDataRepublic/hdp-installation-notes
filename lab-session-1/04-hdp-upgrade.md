# Upgrading to a newer version of Ambari

You now have a running cluster with Ambari 2.2.1.0. However technology is
progressing and a newer versions of Ambari have been released. In this lab you
need to use your skills to upgrade your current cluster to Ambari version 2.4.2.0.

As this process is documented in detail by Hortonworks, you should use this as
a guide for the upgrade process. You may have to translate generic configuration
mentions to the specifics of the cluster you have configured until now.

The documentation can be found [here](http://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/Ambari-2.4.2.0/bk_ambari-upgrade/content/ambari_upgrade_guide.html).

**NOTE:** This is not a process with garuanteed success in the limited scope this
course. If you prefer working on the security lab with the same cluster, you could
consider skipping this step.
